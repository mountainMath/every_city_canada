# How to use EveryCityCanada

As input we need a city as returned by cancensus *list_census_regions*.
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
cities=not_tweeted_cities_list()
city <- dplyr::sample_n(cities,1)
paste0(city$name," (",city$municipal_status,"), Population: ",scales::comma(city$pop))
```

# Plotting the city card
To get the plot for the city we call the *every_city_plot* function. Gathering the data and drawing the vector map can take a little bit of time.
```{r include=FALSE}
image_path=every_city_plot(city)
browseURL(image_path)
```

# Tweeting

To tweet out a random city use the *send_every_city_tweet* function. Optionally specify the city to send out a tweet for a specific city. 

```{r message=FALSE, include=FALSE}
send_every_city_tweet(city,tweeted_cities_path=file.path("..","data","tweeted_cities"))
```
